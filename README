OVERVIEW

This open source platform is currently the foundation of websites, blogs, ecommerce sites, and many more web apps, both business and personal, world wide. The software is packed with features for designers, developers and end-users and its years of development and support have proven it to be mature and stable. Once installed, developers, designers, and end users can collaborate using embedded tools and extended features provided by 3rd parties. For more information, news, documentation and installation instructions visit www.frameworksites.com. 


COMPATABILITY

FWS::V2 is currently used at most major ISPs platforms to power a variety of websites and apps. A compressed version of the software is available with an automated upgrade and installation available at www.frameworksites.com. It is recommended to use the compressed version for maximum compatibility. Live core and element updates are available through the developer administration's easy to use one-click upgrade interface.


PACKAGE DEPENDENCE

Wait a second... why does FWS::V2 seem to have its own home grown methods that are already in popular, well established packages?

One of the main goals of FWS is to have a bundled, autonomous version of the FWS that can be picked up and installed on almost any major ISP or Linux hosting environment without any care for what is present on the server. The packages used by the FWS have been carefully picked and validated to be supported on most all major ISPs.  


MINIMAL WEB RENDERING SCRIPT

This file is usually called /cgi-bin/go.pl

#!/usr/bin/perl

use FWS::V2;

my $fws = FWS::V2->new( # change these to your database you created DBHost => 'localhost', DBName => 'user_fws2', DBUser => 'user_fws2', DBPassword => SupErSecRetPassWoRd', scriptName => '/cgi-bin/go.pl',

    # change these to what makes sense for you server 
    fileSecurePath      => '/home/user/secureFiles/devel',
    filePath            => '/home/user/www/files',
    fileWebPath         => '/files',

    # If you do not have a cert, don't put the https on the secureDomain
    secureDomain        => 'http://www.example.com',
    domain              => 'http://www.example.com',

    # not required but handy to use the tools at frameworksites.com
    FWSKey              => 'this comes from frameworksites.com',
);

$fws->processWeb();

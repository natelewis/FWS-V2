COMPATABILITY

It is recommended to use the compressed version for maximum compatibility. Live core and element updates are available through the developer administration's easy to use one-click upgrade interface.


PACKAGE DEPENDENCE

Wait a second... why does FWS::V2 seem to have its own home grown methods that are already in popular, well established packages?

One of the main goals of FWS is to have a bundled, autonomous version of the FWS that can be picked up and installed on almost any major ISP or Linux hosting environment without any care for what is present on the server. The packages used by the FWS have been carefully picked and validated to be supported on most all major ISPs.
